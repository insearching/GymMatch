# Android Coding Challenge

Greetings, Android Developer!

We invite you to showcase your skills in our Android Coding Challenge. Your task consists in coding a simple application to demonstrate your skills and architectural pattern knowledge. We offer two paths for submission:
- **Develop use case from scratch:** you'd create a simplified app where users swipe to find their ideal gym match, much like a certain infamous dating app.
- **Portfolio reuse:** alternatively, if you have previously developed a project that fits our tech stack requirements, feel free to submit that.

You have up to one week to push your best code to the Classroom assignment repository. In the next phase, you will walk us through your solution and together we'll explore extra scenarios.

We're excited to see your approach to the challenge. Your expertise and take on things could be the perfect match for our team.

Best of luck, and happy coding!

## Requirements

Regardless of which submission path you choose, we expect you to:
- create the UI using Jetpack Compose
- set the minimum Android SDK to 26
- handle any needed permissions in a proper way
- fetch data from a remote endpoint
- cover at least the basic functionality with unit tests
- use kotlin coroutines (optional but encouraged)

Should you decide to code our proposed use case, also keep in mind to:
- use a public gym data endpoint like [OpenGym](https://data.townofcary.org/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/open-gym/records?limit=100)
- design the app as a single-screen that displays gym information and user distance, with a swipe-right-to-like matching interface similar to dating apps
- set the match chance to 10% of the interactions and trigger an animation

## Submission Guidelines

Please submit your project to your **Classroom private GitHub repository**. We will be considering:

- **Fulfillment of Requirements**: Did you cover the essentials?
- **Code Quality**: Is your code organized and maintainable? Is your architectural approach appropriate for the use case?
- **User Interface**: Is the app intuitive and visually appealing?
- **Extra Features**: Any additional functionalities will be noted with interest, _provided you cover all the essentials first_.

## Additional Opportunities

Feel free to enhance your app with:

- real-time location updates using Google Play Services
- additional animations for a dynamic user experience
- accessibility features for wider usability
- more comprehensive tests, including UI tests
- whatever else you see fit for the challenge!
